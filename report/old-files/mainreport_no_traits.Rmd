# Section 1: Headline results

Overall, there were `r nranker` `r rankers` registered to this project. Each `r ranker` assessed `r ncomp` different `r options` for `r length(trait$name)` different traits. Unfortunately, all the `r length(trait$name)` traits assessed in your ClimMob project were not considered for the production of this report as they did not surpassed the thresholds of (1) having at least `r missper` valid entries, and (2) that all the `r options` are tested at least twice per given trait. Please contact the ClimMob Team for support.
