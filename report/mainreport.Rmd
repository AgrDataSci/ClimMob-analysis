# Introduction  

In agriculture, the local environmental conditions determine to a large degree which technological solutions are the most suitable. In dry soils, for example, drought-resistant crop varieties will outperform other varieties, but in wet soils these same varieties may do worse than most. Not only drought, but an entire range of problems including excessive heat, floods, new pests and diseases tend to intensify under climate change. This multitude of limiting factors requires multiple technological solutions, tested in diverse environments. 
 
Citizen science is based on the cooperation of 'citizen scientists' or observers (paid or unpaid). Researchers assign small tasks (observations, experiments) that, once completed and gathered, contribute with a great amount of information to science. One of the advantages of citizen science is that agricultural researchers can get access to many environments by crowdsourcing their experiments. As farmers contribute with their time, skills and knowledge to the investigation, researchers are able to do more tests than in a traditional experimental design. Also citizen scientists acquire new knowledge, abilities and information useful for future challenges of their work.

## ClimMob

The primary goal of ClimMob is to support the selection of innovative technologies (*e.g.* new crop varieties, management, new product). ClimMob serves to prepare and analyze citizen science experiments in which a large number of participants observe and compare different technological options under a wide range of conditions [@vanEtten2019tricot]. 
 
ClimMob software assigns a limited number of items (typically 3) to each participant, who will compare their performance. Each participant gets a different combination of items drawn from a much larger set of items (typically 15-25). Comparisons of this kind are thought to be a very reliable way to obtain data. Once the results of the small tasks have been collected, ClimMob builds an image of the whole set of assigned objects, combining all observations. ClimMob not only reconstructs the overall ordering of items, but also takes into account differences and similarities between participants and the conditions under which they observe (e.g. socio-economic and plot environmental traits). It assigns similar participants to groups that each corresponds among different group profiles. Groups are created on the basis of whichever items which have been collected, that are found to be significantly linked to the observed rankings.
 
ClimMob uses Plackett-Luce models to analyze ranking data with the R [@RCoreTeam] package 'PlackettLuce' [@Turner2020]. It automatically generates analytical reports, as well as individualized information sheets for each participant using the R packages 'knitr' [@knitr] and 'rmarkdown' [@rmarkdown]. Organizing the data relies on packages 'ClimMobTools' [@climmobtools], 'gosset' [@gosset], 'gtools' [@gtools], 'jsonlite' [@jsonlite], 'partykit' [@partykit], 'psychotools' [@psychotools] and 'qvcalc' [@qvcalc]. Summaries and data visualization are supported by packages 'igraph' [@igraph], 'ggparty' [@ggparty], 'ggplot2' [@ggplot2], 'ggrepel' [@ggrepel], 'gridExtra' [@gridExtra] 'leaflet' [@leaflet], 'multcompView' [@multcompView], 'patchwork' [@patchwork], 'png' [@png], 'plotrix' [@plotrix] and 'pls' [@pls].
 

## How to cite

If you publish any results generated with ClimMob, you should cite a number of articles as the package builds on various contributions. The crowdsourcing philosophy behind ClimMob is introduced by van Etten et al. (2019) [@vanEtten2019tricot]. It is important to mention that ClimMob is implemented in R, a free, open-source analysis software [@RCoreTeam]. Methodologically, if you report on the Plackett-Luce tree results, you should mention that ClimMob applies the Plackett-Luce model published by Turner et al. 2020 [@Turner2020]. To cite ClimMob itself, mention van Etten et al. (2020) [@climmob]. The workflow used to produce this report is documented by de Sousa et al. (2021) [@climmobanalysis].

# Section 1: Headline results

Overall, there were `r nranker` `r rankers` registered to this project. Each `r ranker` assessed `r ncomp` different `r options` and ranked them in order of its '`r Ovname`'. In addition, they also provided rankings for `r length(trait$name) -1` additional trait(s). 

```{r trait_drop}

trait_note <- ""

if (length(trait_dropped) > 0) {
  if(length(trait_dropped) > 1) {
    verb <- " were "
    adj <- " traits "
    noun <- " they "
  }else{
    verb <- " was "
    adj <- " trait "
    noun <- " it "
  }
  
  trait_note <- paste0("The", adj, paste(trait_dropped, collapse = ", "), verb, "not considered in this report because", noun, "did not surpass the thresholds of (1) having at least ", minN, " valid entries, and (2) that all the ", options, " are tested at least ", minitem, " times twice per given trait. Table 1.1. shows the traits analysed in this report.")
}
```

`r paste(trait_note, collapse='\n')`

\

```{r traits}

kable(tbl_section1, 
      caption = paste0("Table 1.1. Summary of traits and valid answers used in this report."),

\

Figure 1.1 is a graphical representation of the information presented in Table 1.1, showing the number of valid answers received by each trait in each data collection moment in this project.

```


Table 1.2 shows the `r length(items)` `r options` assessed within this project, with the frequency and percentage of `r rankers` who assessed each `r option`. `r usedlocal` If the `r options` have large names (> 10 characters) an abbreviation was applied across the figures in this report.

```

\

Figure 1.2 shows that the `r options` are all connected to each other. That means that they all co-occurred at least once in an incomplete block of `r ncomp` `r options`.

# Section 2: `r Ovname`, data summary and exploratory analysis

## Assessment of `r options` 

Exploratory analysis within the following section summarises results from the rankings on '`r Ovname`'. Results from other sections, and in the overall summary use Plackett-Luce models [@Turner2020]. Performance of each of the `r options` for '`r Ovname`' is summarized in Table 2.1. The table below shows the number of times each `r option` was tested and the proportion of times it was ranked as the best or worst. Net favorability score is the different between the best and worst ranks for each `r option`. A score of +100 indicates that the `r option` won all 'contests' it was involved in, a score of 0 indicates an equal number of wins and losses, a score of -100 indicates the `r option` lost all contests. 


```{r fav_table}
try(knitr::kable(fav_traits[[reference_trait]][[2]],
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = paste0("Table 2.1. Favorability scores for '", 
                              Ovname, "'." )), 
    silent = TRUE)
```

\

This shows the percentage of `r rankers` who assessed the `r options` as the best among the `r ncomp` `r options` they were provided, the percentage of `r rankers` who included the `r option` as their worst, the percentage of 'head-to-head contests' for which the `r option` won and the net favorability score (Figure 2.1). 

```{r fav_plot, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=6, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 2.1. Net favorability scores for '", Ovname, "'.")}

```

\

```{r best_items}
best_items <- ""
if (isTRUE(nrow(fav_traits[[reference_trait]][[2]]) > 0)) {
  best_items <-
  paste("The", option, fav_traits[[reference_trait]][[2]][[1,1]], "was the 'best'", option, 
  " for the trait ", Ovname, " being ranked highest by", 
  fav_traits[[reference_trait]][[2]][[1,3]], "of the" , 
  nranker, rankers, "who assessed this", option, ".")
}
```

`r paste(best_items, collapse = '\n')`

\

## Pairwise contests 

Figure 2.3 shows the outcomes of all pairwise contests between the `r options` included in the project for '`r Ovname`'. Each panel shows the performance of one `r option` against all the other `r options` and shows the percentage of the times in which the `r option` was ranked above the other `r options` shown as bars. 

```{r contests_bars, dpi=dpi, fig.height=contest_h, fig.width=9, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 2.3. Head to head performance for '", Ovname, "'.")}
plot(vic_traits[[reference_trait]]) +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = "#000000"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = "#000000"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")
  
```

\

## Plackett-Luce Model estimates

\

Table 2.2 shows the results from the likelihood ratio test from the Plackett-Luce model for the trait '`r Ovname`' of the different `r options`. The hypothesis being tested is that there is no difference in the assessments of any of the different `r options`.

```{r, aov1}
try(kable(aov_tables[[reference_trait]], 
      caption = paste0("Table 2.2. Likelihood ratio test results from fitted ", 
      "Plackett-Luce model with rankings from '", 
      Ovname, "'."),
      row.names = FALSE),
  silent = TRUE)
```

\

Figure 2.4 shows the estimates of the model coefficients with `r ci_level*100`% confidence intervals. The purpose of this graph is to be able to best distinguish between the relative strength of each of the `r options` assessed. As such the coefficient estimates themselves are not directly interpretable, but it can be concluded that a higher value for the coefficient indicates that a `r option` has been ranked as best more often. The `r ci_level*100`% confidence width is chosen so that non-overlapping confidence intervals could be interpreted as indicating significant differences at the alpha = `r sig_level`. This may not match exactly with the mean separation groupings, as these groupings also take into account multiple testing through the Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment [@BHtest].

Mean separation analysis was also conducted to indicate, using letters, which `r options` are significantly more preferred than others in terms of '`r Ovname`'. When `r options` have at least one letter in common, there is not enough evidence from the experiment to be confident about their relative order at the alpha = `r sig_level`.

```{r est_plot, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=5, fig.cap=paste0("Figure 2.4. Plackett-Luce Model estimates (log-worth) of tested ", options, " for '", Ovname,"' with ", ci_level*100, "% confidence intervals. Different letters indicate significant differences at p < ", sig_level ,". The ", option, " ", reference, " is set as reference (log-worth arbitrarily set to zero).")}
try(plot_summaries[[reference_trait]],  silent = TRUE)
```

\

The same information in Figure 2.4 is shown in Table 2.3 below.

\

```{r est_table}
try(kable(summaries[[reference_trait]], 
      digits = 4,
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = paste0("Table 2.3. Plackett-Luce Model estimates (log-worth) of tested ", 
                       options, " for '", Ovname,"' with ", ci_level*100, 
                       "% confidence intervals. Different letters indicate significant differences at p < ",
                       sig_level ,". The ", option, " ", reference, 
                       " is set as reference (log-worth arbitrarily set to zero).")),
  silent = TRUE)
```

\

Table 2.4 and Figure 2.5 use the coefficients from the Plackett-Luce model to estimate the probability of each `r option` being considered to be the top ranked `r option` in a direct comparison between all of the possible `r options`.

\

```{r table3.4}
try(kable(worths[[reference_trait]][,-2],
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = paste0("Table 2.4. Probability of being the best ranked for '",
      Ovname, "'.")),
  silent = TRUE)
```

\

```{r rankedfirst, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=5, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 2.5. Probability of being the best ranked for '", Ovname, "'.")}
try(plot_worth_bar(worths[[reference_trait]], value = "Worth", group = Option, nchars = 30),
  silent = TRUE)
```

\

## Plackett-Luce Tree  

A model-based recursive partitioning method [@Strobl2009] was used to determine the effect of covariates in the rankings of `r Ovname`. This approach identifies sub-groups in the data for which the rankings are significantly different to each other. This analysis required that all rankings and covariates are completely available for the entire data set. Here we used `r dim(Gdata)[[1]]` out of `r sum(trait_list[[reference_trait]]$keep)` valid rankings for `r Ovname`. 

```{r covar_statement}
# make the statement if there is any covariate dropped
covar_statement <- paste0("You provided the covariate(s): ", paste(sort(covar$codeQst), collapse = ", "), ". ")
if (covarTRUE) {
  if (isTRUE(length(covar_dropped) > 0)) {
    covar_statement <- paste0(covar_statement,
      "However, the covariates(s) '", paste(covar_dropped, collapse = "', '"),
      "' were not used in the analysis, because they did not surpass ",
      "the threshold of at least ", paste0(mincovar * 100, "%"), " valid entries."
    )
  }
}
```

`r  paste(covar_statement, collapse='\n')`

To select the covariate(s) that best represent the data set, a stepwise regression based on the forward selection approach was used. The procedure begins by fitting each covariate individually and adding new covariates one by one when it makes a single best improvement to the model based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model, the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. In the Plackett-Luce trees, the AIC is obtained by adding the maximized log likelihood ($L$) to the degrees of freedom ($\nu$). 

Equation [1]
$$AIC = -2L +  2\nu$$

```{r}
best_covar <- ""
if (length(tree_f) > 1) {
  best_covar <- paste0("Based on this method, the covariate(s) ", paste(var_keep, collapse = ", and "),
                       " were identified as the most representative to the rankings. The table below ", 
                       "shows the subgroups identified with the selected covariate(s).")
}
```
