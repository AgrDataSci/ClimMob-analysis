You are reading a report generated by ClimMob, a software to design, manage and analyze trial data generated by crowdsourced citizen science.

# Introduction  

In agriculture, the local environmental conditions determine to a large degree which technological solutions are the most suitable. In dry soils, for example, drought-resistant crop varieties will outperform other varieties, but in wet soils these same varieties may do worse than most. Not only drought, but an entire range of problems including excessive heat, floods, new pests and diseases tend to intensify under climate change. This multitude of limiting factors requires multiple technological solutions, tested in diverse environments. 
 
Citizen science is based on the cooperation of citizen scientist or observers (paid or unpaid). Researchers assign microtasks (observations, experiments) that, once completed and gathered, contribute with a great amount of information to science. One of the advantages of citizen science is that agricultural researchers can get access to many environments by crowdsourcing their experiments. As farmers contribute with their time, skills and knowledge to the investigation, researchers are able to do more tests than in a traditional setup. Also citizen scientists acquire new knowledge, abilities and information useful for future challenges of their work.

## ClimMob

The primary goal of ClimMob is to support the selection of innovative technologies (*e.g.* new crop varieties, management, new product). ClimMob was created as part of Bioversity International's research in the CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS). It serves to prepare and analyze citizen science experiments in which a large number of participants observe and compare different technological options under a wide range of conditions [@vanEtten2019tricot]. 
 
ClimMob software assigns a limited number of items (typically 3) to each participant, who will compare their performance. Each participant gets a different combination of items drawn from a much larger set of items (typically 15-25). Comparisons of this kind are thought to be a very reliable way to obtain data. Once the results of the microtasks have been collected, ClimMob builds an image of the whole set of assigned objects, combining all observations. ClimMob not only reconstructs the overall ordering of items, but also takes into account differences and similarities between participants and the conditions under which they observe (e.g. socio-economic and plot environmental characteristics). It assigns similar participants to groups that each corresponds among different group profiles. Groups are created on the basis of whichever items which have been collected, that are found to be significantly linked to the observed rankings.
 
ClimMob uses Plackett-Luce models to analyze ranking data with the R [@RCoreTeam] package 'PlackettLuce' [@Turner2020]. It automatically generates analytical reports, as well as individualized information sheets for each participant using the R packages 'knitr' [@knitr] and 'rmarkdown' [@rmarkdown]. Organizing the data relies on packages 'ClimMobTools' [@climmobtools], 'gosset' [@gosset], 'gtools' [@gtools], 'jsonlite' [@jsonlite], 'partykit' [@partykit], 'psychotools' [@psychotools] and 'qvcalc' [@qvcalc]. Summaries and data visualization are supported by packages 'igraph' [@igraph], 'ggparty' [@ggparty], 'ggplot2' [@ggplot2], 'ggrepel' [@ggrepel], 'gridExtra' [@gridExtra] 'leaflet' [@leaflet], 'multcompView' [@multcompView], 'patchwork' [@patchwork], 'png' [@png], 'plotrix' [@plotrix] and 'pls' [@pls]. The workflow used to analyze the data and produce this report is documented in Zenodo [@analysisCM].
 

## How to cite

If you publish any results generated with ClimMob, you should cite a number of articles as the package builds on various contributions. Van Etten et al. (2019) [@vanEtten2019tricot] introduced the crowdsourcing philosophy behind ClimMob. It is important to mention that ClimMob is implemented in R, a free, open-source analysis software [@RCoreTeam]. Methodologically, if you report on the Plackett-Luce tree results, you should mentioned that ClimMob applies the Plackett-Luce model published by Turner et al. 2020 [@Turner2020]. To cite ClimMob itself, mention van Etten et al. (2020) [@climmob].

# Section 1: Headline results

Overall there were `r nranker` `r rankers` registered to this project. Each `r ranker` assessed `r ncomp` different `r options` and ranked them in order of its '`r ovname`'. In addition they also provided rankings for `r nothertraits` additional characteristic(s): 

```{r characteristics}

kable(tbl_section1, 
      caption = paste0("Table 1.1. Summary of characteristics assessed ", 
                       "in this project and valid answers used in this report."),
      row.names = FALSE,
      align = "l")

```

                               "more than one GPS location per each", ranker, "the map",
                               "below shows the GPS registry which had the largest number",

```

\

Table 1.2 shows the `r options` assessed within this project, with the frequency and percentage of `r rankers` who assessed each `r option`. If the `r options` have large names (> 10 characters) an abbreviation was applied across the figures in this report.

```{r itemtable}
kable(itemtable, 
      caption = paste0("Table 1.2. Frequency of ", options," assessed."),
      align = "l")
```

\

Figure 1.1 shows that the `r options` are all connected to each other. That means that they all co-occurred at least once in an incomplete block of `r ncomp` `r options`. 

```{r network, dpi=dpi, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, fig.cap=paste0("Figure 1.1. Network representation of ", options, " tested in this project.")}

}
```

# Section 2: Data summary and exploratory analysis of characteristics

## Assessment of `r options` 

Exploratory analysis within the following section summarises results from the data directly. Given the structure of a ClimMob trail, where each `r ranker` only assessed `r ncomp` of the `r nitems` possible `r options` these results may be skewed if certain `r options` were randomly assigned to face worse `r options` than others. This is particularly a potential issue within a smaller trial, as due to the randomisation process the potential for an unbalanced assignment decreases as the sample size increases. Results from other sections, and in the overall summary use Plackett-Luce models [@Turner2020], to adjust for any imbalance.

### `r Ovname`

Performance of each of the `r options` for the characteristic '`r ovname`' is summarised in Table 2.1. 


```{r fav_table}
knitr::kable(fav2,
             row.names = FALSE,
             caption = paste0("Table 2.1. Favourability scores for the characteristic '", 
                              ovname, "'." ))
```

\

This shows the percentage of `r rankers` who assessed the `r options` as the best among the `r ncomp` `r options` they were provided, the percentage of `r rankers` who included the `r option` as their worst, the percentage of 'head to head contests' for which the `r option` won and the net *favourability* score. A score of +100 indicates the `r option` won all 'contests' it was involved in, a score of 0 indicates an equal number of wins and losses, a score of -100 indicates the `r option` lost all contests. 

```{r fav_plot, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=6, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 2.1. Net favourability score for the characteristic '", ovname, "'.")}
plot(fav1)
```

\

```{r best_items}

if (isTRUE(nothertraits > 0)) {
  fav_other_chars <-

         "other characteristics assessed in this project.")
} 
```

`r paste(fav_other_chars, collapse='\n')`

}

```

```{r fav_include, echo=FALSE, results="asis", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat(paste(trait_summaries, collapse = '\n'))
```


## Pairwise contests 

\

### `r Ovname`

Figure 2.2 shows the outcomes of all pairwise contests between the `r options` included in the project for '`r ovname`'. Each panel shows the performance of one `r option` against all the other `r options`, and shows the percentage of the times in which the panelled `r option` was ranked above the other `r options` shown as bars. 

```{r contests_bars, dpi=dpi, fig.height=contest_h, fig.width=9, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 2.2. Head to head performance for the characteristic '", ovname, "'.")}

# Section 3: Data summary and exploratory analysis of covariates  

The effect of covariates on the rankings of `r options` was explored with Plackett-Luce trees using the following covariates (Table 3.1)

\

```{r expvar_table}
kable(data.frame("Short name" = expvar_list$expvar_code, 
                 "Question" = expvar_list$expvar_full, 
                 check.names = FALSE),
      caption = "Table 3.1. Covariates used in this project.")
```

\

## `r Ovname`

Table 3.2 shows the results from the likelihood ratio test from the Plackett-Luce model for the characteristic '`r ovname`' of the different `r options`. The hypothesis being tested is that there is no difference in the assessments of any of the different `r options`.

```{r, aov1}
kable(aov_mod_overall, 
      caption = paste0("Table 3.2. Likelihood ratio test results from fitted ", 
      "Plackett-Luce model with rankings from the characteristic '", 
      ovname, "'."))
```

\

Figure 3.1 shows the estimates of the model coefficients with `r ci_level*100`% confidence intervals. The purpose of this graph is to be able to best distinguish between the relative strength of each of the `r options` assessed. As such the coefficient estimates themselves are not directly interpretable, but it can be concluded that a higher value for the coefficient indicates that a `r option` has been ranked as best more often. The `r ci_level*100`% confidence width is chosen so that non-overlapping confidence intervals could be interpreted as indicating significant differences at the alpha = `r sig_level`. This may not match exactly with the mean separation groupings, as these groupings also take into account multiple testing through the Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment [@BHtest].

Mean separation analysis was also conducted to indicate, using letters, which `r options` are significantly more preferred than others; when `r options` have at least one letter in common, there is not enough evidence from the experiment to be confident about their relative order at the alpha = `r sig_level`.

```{r est_plot, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=5, fig.cap=paste0("Figure 3.1. Model coefficients and mean separation of Plackett-Luce model for the characteristic '", ovname, "' with ", ci_level*100, "% confidence intervals.")}
plot(mod_sum_PL)
```

\

The same information as Figure 3.1 is shown in Table 3.3 below.

\

```{r est_table}
kable(model_summaries, 
      digits = 4,
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = paste0("Table 3.3. Model coefficients and mean separation of ",
                       options," with an alpha = ", sig_level, "."))
```

\

Table 3.4 and Figure 3.2 use the coefficients from the Plackett-Luce model to estimate the probability of each `r option` being considered to be the top ranked `r option` in a direct comparison between all of the possible `r options`.

\

```{r table3.4}
kable(worthscaled[,-2],
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = paste0("Table 3.4. Percentage probability of being the best ranked for ",
      "the characteristic '", ovname, "'."))
```

```{r rankedfirst, dpi=dpi, fig.height=favplot_h, fig.width=5, fig.cap= paste0("Figure 3.2. Probability of being the best ranked for the characteristic '", ovname, "'.")}

# Section 5: Plackett-Luce models with covariates  

## `r Ovname`  

A model-based recursive partitioning method [@Strobl2009] was used to determine which of the explanatory variables, if any, had significant relationships with the rankings. This approach identifies sub-groups in the data for which the rankings of the different varieties are significantly different to each other. 

```{r}
effect_covar_statement2 <- ""
effect_covar_statement3 <- ""
if (isTRUE(length(tree_f) > 1))  {
  if (isTRUE(any(na.omit(outtabs[[1]]$p.value) < sig_level))) {
    effect_covar_statement2 <- 
      paste("Table 5.1 shows the p-values for each of the covariates tested,", 
            "one-by-one, showing whether or not the covariate could be used", 
            "to define sub-groups with significantly different rankings.")
    
    effect_covar_statement3 <-
      paste("The partitioning of the rankings based on the most significantly", 
        "sub-groups which were identified from the data using an alpha =", 
        sig_level, "is shown in Figure 5.1. At the top of the tree is the", 
        "full dataset, then working down through the different levels of", 
        "the tree shows the combinations of variables which define each", 
        "subgroup. The model parameters are shown for the final subgroups", 
        "in the plot at the bottom of the tree. The model quasi-variance", 
        "estimates, along with", ci_level*100, "% confidence intervals are",
